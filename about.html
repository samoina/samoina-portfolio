                <p>Samoina is a lover of life, a mom of one and a fitness enthusiast. Fitness has continued to be a part
                    of my life, although I have been doing a poor job keeping up on my Instagram account (Follow me
                    @fitmom.ke ). I started my journey in late 2018 thereabout, and have kept up with it for the most
                    part. I have days, even weeks when I can’t bring myself to lift a dumbell – but try to walk almost
                    daily. Somehow, I always find it in me to pick it up and continue from wherever I paused.</p>
                <p>I started to learn how to code in March 2021 after I enrolled for a prep course at Moringa School.
                    The interest in coding, and how I got the chance to learn is one that I should probably share in a
                    later blogpost. In this prep course, we covered HTML, CSS and Javascript. I always chuckle when I
                    remember a meme that said the C in CSS is for crying. How true this is, CSS is simple from afar, but
                    far from simple once you get into it. I am still practising, not as often as I would want to though.
